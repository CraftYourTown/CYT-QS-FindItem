# Contributing to Shop Search AddOn

If you are a developer and have experience in making bukkit/spigot plugins, you can contribute to the Shop Search AddOn codebase. Just make a fork and then make a pull request when you're done. Please try to follow the [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Also, please don't increase the plugin version number. I will be taking care of that.

### How to compile?
1. Make sure you're using Java 17 JDK in your PATH.
2. Open command prompt in the root folder and run `mvn clean install`
